## Manuscript description

<!-- usage note: edit this section. -->
The salivary microbiome, a complex ecosystem within the human oral cavity, has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in maintaining oral and systemic health. Saliva, a key component in the oral environment, is not only essential for various physiological functions but also acts as a medium that influences the composition and activity of the oral microbiota.
